Practices facing this issue are at great risk for losing out on revenue each year, with an estimated 25% of denied claims never being paid at all. If your organization’s denial rates are particularly high, it’s crucial to address and resolve these issues to continue serving patients and generating revenue. One of the most effective ways to prevent such denials is by evaluating and assessing your practice’s revenue cycle.`,

The most frequent cause is missing or incorrect information, such as demographic details, procedural codes, or diagnosis codes. Another major issue is the failure to conduct prior authorization. Additional causes include not meeting medical necessity requirements, procedures not being covered due to eligibility issues, payer processing errors, providers being out of network, and complications with coordination of benefits. These denials lead to revenue loss and create more work for billing staff, who must then reevaluate and resubmit the claims. Performing a revenue cycle assessment can significantly reduce these occurrences.`,

One important step is understanding your key performance indicators, such as net collection rate and days in accounts receivable, and comparing them with industry standards. This allows you to identify areas for improvement. Evaluating the current workflow from registration through insurance follow-up helps expose inefficiencies. It's also essential to assess the tools and software used in the process and gather staff feedback to understand what works well. Reviewing staffing levels is equally important, including how many people are needed at each step, and how factors like patient demographics and technology affect workflow. This assessment helps inform better staffing decisions going forward.`,
